    <string name="welcome">Welcome to ChatterWave! \n \n
        These Terms of Use (or "Terms") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the "Service"), outlined below.\n
When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. \n \n
</string>
    <string name="the_ChatterWave_service">The ChatterWave Service \n</string>
    <string name="the_ChatterWave_service_text">We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the ChatterWave products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance ChatterWave’s mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects: \n\n
    \t  •	Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share.
People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram. \n\n
    \t  •	Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment.
We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. \n\n
    \t  •	Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.
Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service. \n\n
    \t  •	Ensuring access to our Service.
To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates. \n\n
    \t  •	Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about.
We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram. \n\n
    \t  •	Research and innovation.
We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. \n\n

</string>
    <string name="your_commitments">Your commitments \n</string>
    <string name="your_commitments_text">
        In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below commitments to us.
Who can use Instagram. We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community. \n\n
    \t  •	You must be at least 13 years old or the minimum legal age in your country to use Instagram.  \n\n
    \t  •	You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable laws or engaging in payments-related Services if you are on an applicable denied party listing. \n\n
    \t  •	We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our policies. \n\n
    \t  •	You must not be a convicted sex offender. \n\n
How you can\'t use Instagram. Providing a safe and open Service for a broad community requires that we all do our part. \n\n
    \t  •	You can\'t impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.
You don\'t have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren\'t, and you can\'t create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission. \n\n
    \t  •	You can\'t do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose. \n\n
    \t  •	You can\'t violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the \n\n
    \t  •	You can\'t do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service.
This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals. \n\n
    \t  •	You can\'t attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways.
This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission. \n\n
    \t  •	You can\'t sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service.
This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens. \n\n
    \t  •	You can\'t post someone else\'s private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else\'s rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).
You may use someone else\'s works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law. You represent that you own or have obtained all necessary rights to the content you post or share. Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights. \n\n
    \t  •	You can\'t modify, translate, create derivative works of or reverse engineer our products or their components. \n\n
    \t  •	You can\'t use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent. \n\n

    <string name="permissions_you_give_to_us_text">Permissions you give to us. As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service. \n\n
    \t  •	We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it.
    \t  Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a "licence") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. \n\n
    \t  •	Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content.
    \t  You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Meta Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. \n\n
    \t  •	You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device. \n\n

    \t  •	If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone\'s intellectual property or impersonates another user). \n\n
    \t  •	If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours). \n\n
    \t  •	You must obtain written permission from us or under an open-source licence to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us. \n\n

    <string name="content_removal">Content removal and disabling or terminating your account \n</string>
    <string name="content_removal_text">
    \t  •	We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies, if you repeatedly infringe other people\'s intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems. \n\n
    \t  •	Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations: \n\n
    \t\t  •	where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or  \n\n
    \t\t  •	where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or \n\n
    \t\t  •	where deletion would restrict our ability to: \n\n
    \t\t\t  •	investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems); \n\n
    \t\t\t  •	protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users; \n\n
    \t\t\t  •	comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or \n\n
    \t\t\t  •	comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency; \n\n
    \t\t  •	in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis). \n\n
    \t\t •	If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called "Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted. \n\n
